# Rigging.js 

Rigging.js is an open-source react.js application, that takes the keypoints generated by the face mesh tensorflow.js model, then map the movement that the person is doing in front of the camera into a 3d model. Any model downloaded from https://www.mixamo.com/ can be used.

# Build And Run
````
git clone https://github.com/haruiz/RiggingJs.git
cd RiggingJs
npm install
npm start
```` 

## Try with different models

As mentioned above, any model downloaded from https://www.mixamo.com/ can be used. These models are freely available.

## Roadmap

- Automatic Rigging and Animation of 3D Characters: using the current state of the art deep learning models.
- 3D expression animation using facemesh model 
- Record animation

You can see the detailed [roadmap](https://github.com/haruiz/RiggingJs/projects/1) here.

## Inspiration taken from:

- [Pose Animator 2](https://github.com/yemount/pose-animator): Pose Animator takes a 2D vector illustration and animates its containing curves in real-time based on the recognition result from PoseNet and FaceMesh. It borrows the idea of skeleton-based animation from computer graphics and applies it to vector characters.
- [PoseNet Model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet):
This package contains a standalone model called PoseNet, as well as some demos, for running real-time pose estimation in the browser using TensorFlow.js.
- [BodyPix](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/body-pix): This package contains a standalone model called BodyPix, as well as some demos, for running real-time person and body part segmentation in the browser using TensorFlow.js.
- [MediaPipe Facemesh](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/facemesh): MediaPipe Facemesh is a lightweight machine learning pipeline predicting 486 3D facial landmarks to infer the approximate surface geometry of a human face (paper).
